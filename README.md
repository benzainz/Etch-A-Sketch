# SketchPad

## Overview
SketchPad is a simple, interactive web application that allows users to create drawings by coloring squares on a grid. Users can choose different colors, erase their drawings, and resize the grid for more detailed work. The application is designed to be user-friendly and responsive, making it accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Features
- **Coloring Mode:** Allows users to draw on the grid using black, gray, or a random rainbow color.
- **Eraser Mode:** Users can switch to eraser mode to remove parts of their drawing.
- **Dynamic Grid Size:** The grid can be resized to accommodate more or fewer squares, giving users control over the level of detail in their drawings.
- **Reset Board:** Clears the entire grid to start a new drawing.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5:** Provides the structure for the web application.
- **CSS3:** Handles the styling, including layout, buttons, and responsive design.
- **JavaScript:** Implements the core functionality of the application, such as coloring, erasing, and grid resizing.
- **Reset.css:** A CSS reset file used to normalize styles across different browsers.

## File Structure
- `index.html`: The main HTML file that structures the content of the webpage.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file that styles the application, including layout and design elements.
- `reset.css`: A CSS reset file to ensure consistent styling across different browsers.
- `main.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the logic for coloring, erasing, and interacting with the grid.
